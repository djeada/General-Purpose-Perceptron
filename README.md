# NeuraCommand

NeuraCommand is an advanced Command Line Interface (CLI) tool specifically tailored for the creation, training, and deployment of neural networks. It offers a streamlined experience for managing complex neural network structures, including multi-layer perceptrons. This tool enables users to efficiently perform tasks such as data loading, model training, prediction, and saving trained models for future usage or additional training.

## Features

- **Intuitive CLI**: User-friendly command-line interface simplifying all neural network operations.
- **Customizable Network Architectures**: Easily configure neural networks with diverse layers and structures.
- **Matrix Input Support**: Compatible with various matrix data formats for network training.
- **Persistent Model Management**: Capability to save and reload models for ongoing training or future use.
- **Immediate Predictions**: Deploy trained networks for real-time prediction tasks.
- **Layer Output Visualization**: Display outputs from all layers to understand network processing.
- **Model Selection Flexibility**: Choose from multiple trained models for specific tasks.
- **Prediction-Only Mode**: Option to use the tool solely for making predictions.

## Installation

Install NeuraCommand using pip:

```shell
pip install gp_perceptron_framework
```

## Usage

Basic usage of NeuraCommand:

```bash
# Create a new neural network
neuracommand create-network --layers 3 --neurons 64

# Load data for training
neuracommand load-data --file path/to/data.csv

# Train the network
neuracommand train --epochs 100

# Save the trained model
neuracommand save-model --output model.ncmd

# Make predictions
neuracommand predict --input sample_input.csv
```

## Quickstart

Example code for using NeuraCommand in Python:

```python
from gp_perceptron_framework import GeneralPurposePerceptron

# Initialize a network
network = GeneralPurposePerceptron()

# Add layers
network.add_layer(neuron_count=5)  # Hidden layer
network.add_layer(neuron_count=3)  # Output layer

# Train the network
data = [([0.1, 0.2, 0.3], [0, 1, 0])]  # (input, output) pairs
network.train(data, epochs=10)

# Predictions
inputs = [0.1, 0.2, 0.3]
outputs = network.predict(inputs)
print(outputs)  # Example output: [0.2, 0.8, 0.1]

# Evaluate performance
performance = network.evaluate(data)
print(performance)  # Example loss: 0.05
```

## Advanced Features

- **Non-Linearly Separable Data Handling**: NeuraCommand provides specialized tools and techniques for handling complex, non-linearly separable datasets. This feature is particularly useful for datasets like `make_moons` from `sklearn`, where traditional linear models fall short. The tool includes functionalities for preprocessing such datasets, applying various transformation techniques, and utilizing advanced neural network architectures that are adept at capturing non-linear relationships.

- **Layer Process Inspection**: This feature offers a deep dive into the internal workings of each layer within the neural network during both the training and prediction phases. Users can monitor the activation outputs, weight adjustments, and error propagation in real-time. This transparency is crucial for understanding and optimizing the network's learning process, troubleshooting issues, and improving overall model performance.

- **Model Export and Import**: Enhanced capabilities for exporting and importing neural network models are a cornerstone of NeuraCommand. Users can export trained models, including their architecture, weights, and training state, into a portable format. This makes it easy to share models, deploy them in different environments, or continue training at a later stage. The import functionality allows users to seamlessly load and integrate pre-trained models, facilitating model reuse and collaborative development.

## TODO

- **Implement a Tutorial for Non-Linear Datasets**: Develop a comprehensive tutorial focused on classifying non-linearly separable datasets using NeuraCommand. This tutorial should cover the end-to-end process, from data loading and preprocessing to model training and evaluation.

`from sklearn.datasets import make_moons`

- **Enhance CLI for Network Analytics**: Expand the command-line interface to include more detailed network analytics and diagnostics. This expansion should encompass advanced metrics, visualization tools for training progress, and detailed error analysis. The goal is to provide users with a more nuanced understanding of their model's performance and behavior.

- **Develop Advanced Architecture Documentation**: Create additional documentation and practical examples for advanced neural network architectures, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and Transformer models. This documentation should guide users through the intricacies of these architectures, their use cases, and how to implement them effectively in NeuraCommand.

- **Integrate Advanced Optimization Techniques**: Plan the integration of advanced optimization techniques and learning rate schedules into NeuraCommand. This includes implementing adaptive learning rate algorithms, regularization methods, and dropout techniques to improve model robustness and performance.
