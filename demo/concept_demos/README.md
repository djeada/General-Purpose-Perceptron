# Concept Demos

This directory contains a collection of scripts that demonstrate various concepts in neural networks and machine learning. Each script uses the `neura_command` library to illustrate and visualize these concepts in action.

## Contents

- `backpropagation.py`: Demonstrates the backpropagation algorithm used for training neural networks.
- `gradient_descent.py`: Shows how the gradient descent optimization algorithm works in finding the minimum of a function.
- `perceptron_learning.py`: Provides an example of training a simple perceptron model.

## Usage

To run these examples, navigate to the `concept_demos` directory and execute the desired script. For example:

```bash
python backpropagation.py
```

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the `neura_command` library installed and properly configured in your environment before running these scripts.
