# Practical Demos

This directory contains practical examples and real-world use cases that demonstrate the application of various machine learning and neural network concepts. These examples showcase how the `neura_command` library can be used to solve specific problems or address common scenarios.

## Contents

- `digit_recognition`: An example of training a neural network to recognize handwritten digits.
- `linear_regression`: Demonstrates linear regression, a fundamental technique in predictive modeling.
- `logical_operations`: Shows how neural networks can be used to perform logical operations.
- `schroedinger_equation`: Illustrates the use of neural networks in solving the Schr√∂dinger equation.
- `snake_ai`: An example of training an AI agent to play the game of Snake.

## Usage

Each subdirectory in the `practical_demos` section contains its own `main.py` script and a README file with detailed instructions on how to run and use the example. To execute a specific example, navigate to its directory and follow the instructions provided in the README.

```bash
cd digit_recognition
python main.py
```

## Prerequisites

Before running any of these examples, make sure you have the necessary dependencies and the `neura_command` library installed. Refer to the README in each example's directory for specific requirements.
